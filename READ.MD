## Basic of Three.js

# Light
* [AmbientLight](AmbientLight.md) - AmbientLight 
used to simulate the light from the environment in all directions.
* [DirectionalLight](DirectionalLight.md) - DirectionalLight
used to simulate the light from a single direction.
* [HemisphereLight](HemisphereLight.md) - HemisphereLight
used to simulate the light from up and down directions (sky and ground).
* [React Area Light](Light.md) -  React Area Light
used to simulate the light from a single direction with a specific area. (height and width) for indore and outdoor. 
* [Directed Light](DirectedLight.md) - Directed Light
used for shadow casting. and it is a light source that emits light in a specific direction. on specific target object.
* [Point Light](PointLight.md) - Point Light
used for shadow casting. and it is a light source that emits light in all directions from a specific point.
* [Spot Light](SpotLight.md) - Spot Light
work as flash light or torch light. it is a light source that emits light in a specific direction from a specific point. (angle , direction , distance , penumbra , decay , target)

# Camera
* [Perspective Camera](PerspectiveCamera.md) - Perspective Camera
used to simulate the camera with perspective view. (fov , aspect , near , far)
* [Orthographic Camera](OrthographicCamera.md) - Orthographic Camera
used to simulate the camera with orthographic view. (left , right , top , bottom , near , far) used for 2D games.
lookAt() - used to set the camera target. (x , y , z)

# Shadow
* Ponit Light Shadow
* Directed Light Shadow
* Spot Light Shadow
they all cause shadow casting. and it is a light source that emits light in a specific direction from a specific point.
